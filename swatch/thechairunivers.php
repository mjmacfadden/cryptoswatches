        <h1>THE CHAIR UNIVERS</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</p>
        <p>I am an anonymous artist, I live in Brazil and I am creating a unique and authentic universe of physical and digital collectibles.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>I was inspired by tales about ancient and forgotten civilizations. I believe that before me, chairs did not have the proper recognition, and were a kind of lost civilization that I found.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital world?</strong></p>
        <p>The planning was done more than 1 year ago, and the first wax mint is about 10 months old.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t have a graphics table, I talk to the chairs and they explain things to me and tell me about the chairs, and then I can draw all this with a regular pencil and then I move it to the computer, I finish using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>My biggest influences are collectibles like kinder, hotwheels, barbie, imaginext, max steel and others. Maur&iacute;cio de Sousa is the creator of Turma da M&ocirc;nica, I grew up reading these comics with my family, so he is a big influence for me. My mother is a painter and seamstress, this influences me a lot too.</p>
        <p><strong>What made you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>Since I was a child I have been passionate about collectibles and I create collections. I was looking for a way to sell my paintings digitally and didn&rsquo;t know about the existence of nfts, so when I discovered Wax, my mind exploded.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find it online?</strong></p>
