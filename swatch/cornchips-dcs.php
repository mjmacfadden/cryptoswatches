        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Matt Hill and I&rsquo;m a signwriter, designer, artist, animation rookie, website building and marketing enthusiast&hellip; Basically a creative that keeps learning new applications for his ideas. From Sydney Australia.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>The Damn Tasty Corn Chips was an art project that was meant for the walls of Mexican restaurants and Inner Sydney suburb cafes. I was planning on printing and framing them and trying to sell the art on consignment. Then I fell into NFTs.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>Since I started signwriting I was designing digital artworks professionally from 1998. But was was playing with art programs and underdeveloped Photoshop type apps since we had our Compaq Presario when I was maybe 10. Which was early 1990s.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>I use Adobe illustrator, Photoshop, premiere pro&hellip; There&rsquo;s no work flow really. Just chaotic realisations of ideas I want to see outside my brain. The tools help to create those images.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Mr Squiggle The man from the moon, Blackbeard ltd, Jack Daniels and a lot of time staring into nothing thinking what I should do next.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>A friend told me I should look into it when I was creating racing liveries. Another friend @dedhedartist showed me how.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ll keep doing what I do even if no one buys it. I love what I do.</p>
        <p>Thanks so much for the Collab! The people in the NFT space, wax especially is a brilliant community and most want to work together.</p>
