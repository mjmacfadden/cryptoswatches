        <h1>Krypto Kumas</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Sup Kuma&rsquo;s! My name is MechaMonsterBo1, the artist and creator behind THE KRYPTO KUMAS and THE M3CHA BO1Z brands.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>My Whole life I wanted to create my own stories, my own worlds, my own fan-base. I grew up in the 90&rsquo;s where Cartoons, Anime, Comics and Video Games were a major influence on me as an artist. Not just as an artist, but as a young kid looking to locate his place in life. Pop-Culture was a safe-haven for my generation and gave us &ldquo;Outcast&rdquo; worlds filled with creativity and understanding, to help teach us important life lessons.</p>
        <p>A young &ldquo;Robotic-Boy&rdquo; with a mask and his hood-up, hiding his undying love for everything Pop-Culture. Being a Creator and an Artist was my release from it all. But as I got older, it never stopped. The cartoons, the comics, the movies, the collecting, it had all gone well past my mid-20s with no regrets.</p>
        <p>The Krypto Kuma&rsquo;s are not just dressed up bears to me, it gave me a feeling of belonging, that nostalgic feeling of Saturday mornings, being a kid and having a community of friends to &ldquo;NERD-OUT&rdquo; with. To have fun and build worlds together.</p>
        <p>I am from Pittsburgh PA, here in the United States. For this piece with Crypto Swatches I was inspired to provide a fun colorful kuma to really bring out the swatches, and give collectors of both communities a fun asset to own.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I have been creating in the digital realm for maybe 3 months now. I started on WAX and have grown our collection of the Krypto Kumas onto Open Sea as well, in a stronger format.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>I started creating the Kuma on my PC using&nbsp;<a dir="ltr" href="https://t.co/52yRe2mq8n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://Paint.net</a>&nbsp;an opensource program. After a few months into the space, I have recently gotten an iPad Gen 9. And now I am able to provide more quality work to our collectors.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Most of my Artistic Influences are all cartoons/anime related, there are a few artist that I have come across in the NFT space that I absolutely love as well.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>My Uncle had talked me into crypto awhile back in 2017 or so, and when I invested before 2019 and the big-boom into BTC. I was certain crypto was the way. Years later, my uncle would be the same person that talked me into NFTs knowing I was an artist.</p>
        <p>I began collecting on WAX and then started creating. Its been history ever since.</p>
