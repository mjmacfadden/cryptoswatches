        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Fresh, I am the Designer and 1/2 owner at Disguised Pigeons with my best friend Reffy. We are both located in remote Australia and are childhood friends.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>Our inspiration for our submission, was to capture the vibrant colours you traditionally find in swatch/Pantone booklet.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>We started our trading card game in October last year, it has been one of the best journeys we have ever had.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>I generally use a computer and use different software, ranging from AI and Flexisign.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>My background comes from branding and sign making, I take a lot of what I do everyday and put into our project.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>We started our crypto journey together in March 2021, when we heard about NFT&rsquo;s we wanted to combine both aspects. We also collect Funko pops in real life, so we wanted to base our project around trading and collecting.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>You can follow the project page on Twitter @ DPIGEONSNFT.</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>We want to personally thank the CryptoSwatch team for collaborating with us and also showing the world how amazing the WAX blockchain is.</p>
