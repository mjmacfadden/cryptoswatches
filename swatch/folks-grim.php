        <h1>Folks Grim</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you(who are you, what do you do professionally or otherwise, where are you located in the world)?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a freelance illustrator. Started working on my own in 2002 and I&rsquo;ve done works for advertising, television, publishing, news media, humor magazines, etc. Some of my clients in the past have been Disney Europe, Sony, Hilton Hotels, International Barcelona Comicon, etc &hellip; I&rsquo;m from Barcelona.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this project?</strong></p>
        <p>The inspiration for this piece was the current series of our Grim Folks &ldquo;Garage&rdquo;, where our characters start a tour with their crazy machines. I thought those automobiles could get broken and we would need someone to fix them !!</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>If you mean the NFT world, I started in February!! I didn&rsquo;t know about this medium before. I thought it had great possibilities for artists like me.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>My workflow is not complicated: I think about what character or scene I would like to portray and then I try to give it a humorous crazy twist.<br />I sketch and ink most of the pieces on Bristol paper and have an original piece of art, then I scan them to give color. I love to give a classic antique look. I use Photoshop cause I have all my brushes there, but sometimes I also use Procreate.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic/photographic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>My influences are varied&hellip; I love Bob Larkin, Earl Norem, William George, Michael Kaluta to name a few geniuses, but in humor, my true masters are Jack Davis, Wally Wood, and Mort Drucker. The Mad magazine-style.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I had read some information about NFTs but didn&rsquo;t understand the concept well initially. Then, one day, Santi (my partner now) approached me with the idea of releasing a collection for Wax and he started giving me lessons about how all this works, and I&rsquo;ve been learning bit by bit thanks to him.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online (Twitter, website, Instagram, OpenSea, Rarible, etc?)</strong></p>
        <div>You can find me at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alexgallego.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.alexgallego.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626893990465000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFnSYpEslJ-xoPBPND7JhcWIgUOKg">www.alexgallego.com</a>&nbsp;and then on Instagram and Twitter by&nbsp;<a href="https://web.telegram.org/?legacy=1#/im?p=%40gariebo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.telegram.org/?legacy%3D1%23/im?p%3D%2540gariebo&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626893990465000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBXbr9tg_tMKcpDVPrIlU2_bK6QA">@gariebo</a>.&nbsp;I also have an opensea account but I haven&rsquo;t sold anything yet!&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/AlexGallego" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://opensea.io/AlexGallego&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626893990465000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTiPTj0i1poAyRe3JczsYF7uZ0YQ">https://opensea.io/AlexGallego</a></div>
        <div><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></div>
        <div>Last thing: I still believe that art itself should be/will be the most interesting part of collecting NFTs instead of raw investment. I hope someday it will be as I say &hellip; I think is what an artist aspires to ðŸ˜‰</div>
