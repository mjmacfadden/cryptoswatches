        <h1>Low Poly Media</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Jim van Hazendonk, I&rsquo;m a 3D designer living in Austria, I love low poly designs and minimalism</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>I was asked to collaborate and since I had a large collection of vehicles I made some time ago, I asked what vehicle Crypto Swatches wanted me to make. I updated the vehicle that was chosen to a refreshed look. I would not have chosen that specific vehicle. Which gave me a challenge. That&rsquo;s how I like to work.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s hard to say when exactly I started. It has been a decade or 2 for sure&hellip; if not longer ðŸ™‚ But it has only been a couple of months that I took interest in crypto art and refreshing my older work.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>I love to play with simple forms and low poly designs. Reducing ideas to their essentials. My primary drive is to make things that can be combined. All my work is modular and interchangeable. All the cars I created for example have the same general size and all the wheels can be interchanged. The buildings and other things are proportionally sized and modular. So I can create many different environments relatively quickly. I love this kind of work. I mainly use open source software. For a long time, I could not afford the expensive programs. My main tool of trade is Blender. Been using it for more than 15 years. It&rsquo;s my go to to quickly design or explore the ideas I have in my head. Inkscape and Krita are the other main tools.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>A friend of mine with whom I used to work, Kenney. He gave me insight how to create cool designs</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>Well at first I could not understand why those things have value. But once I understood the concept behind them&hellip; it was a no brainer. I have made so much things that it would be a shame not to create some NFT&rsquo;s for other people to enjoy</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>My NFT project can be found on twitter&nbsp;<a title="@lowpolymedia" href="https://twitter.com/lowpolymedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@lowpolymedia</a>.</p>
        <p>The website for my NFT&rsquo;s can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lowpoly.media/">www.lowpoly.media</a>. I&rsquo;m open for collaboration and exchanges of ideas and I welcome all who want to follow me</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you want to share:</strong></p>
        <p>Commission work is something I do too. So if there is someone interested or in need of 3D art. I&rsquo;m open for work. People can contact me on my website&nbsp;<a title="www.racoon.media" href="https://www.racoon.media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.racoon.media</a>.</p>
