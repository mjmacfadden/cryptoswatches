        <h1>DOGSQUADNFT</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hey all! My name is Mike Ice&nbsp;<a title="@mikeice1" href="https://twitter.com/mikeice1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mikeice1</a>&nbsp;the co-creator of DogsquadNFT. From California. Traveled the states as a Vivint smart home technician. Was an award winning artist at the Fresno fair freshman year of high school. Have always pursued art and gaming as two passions.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>The inspiration behind the project was to rescue as many dogs in Fresno County, CA. One of the worst homeless and not vetted dog places in the country. I currently work with &ldquo;559 paw squad&rdquo; myself and my girlfriend Justine have rescued over ten dogs through foster care this last year and wanted to expand their mission. 50% of proceeds go to them 25% to community and rewards and 25% to the artist and project growth.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Artist influences are Renaissance painters and also some of the original concepts in the space. From BAYC to Cryptopunks. Simplicity I&rsquo;ve found is key and the art drives the point with a message behind it.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>First interest in NFTS was NBAtopshot and then I found wax and fell in love!</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>Currently online is only Twitter:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Will be on WAX Blockchain.</p>
