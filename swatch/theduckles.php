        <h1>The Duckles</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m Andrew aka TiDBYTS. You may already know me from our Duck Butt series, which I created with my 9 year old son. I&rsquo;m a doctor by day and have found that creating art through NFTs is a great way to decompress from all the stress in the hospital!</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>I created the Duck Butts with my son, which is still ongoing and a lot of fun. I also have a 4 year old daughter, and she saw all the fun we were having and wanted to join in (and maybe was a little jealous)! My daughter loves the color pink, and also sparkles and glitter and unicorns and all things fluffy. So we created The Duckles, a super fun, pinktastic, sparkle and glitter filled NFT collection designed to inspire creativity and curiosity in kids.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>It feels like decades, but it&rsquo;s only been a year! Since March 2021.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>I use Procreate on the iPad exclusively for drawing The Duckles, and then Photoshop for touch ups and fine tuning. I somehow convinced my sister, who is a more traditionally trained artist, to join our Duckles team. She does all of the amazing backgrounds for our project, and exclusive features like our Art of the Duckles drops for hodlers (copies of the artwork that hangs in the Duckle Family house!). She works exclusively with Procreate as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Love Miyazaki and all things Studio Ghibli.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>Our entry was through AlienWorlds, which quickly turned into creating our own NFTs (DuckDuckMoos) which then spawned The Duck Butts. The amazing WAX community has kept us in NFTs, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do any of this without such amazing support and inspiration from so many fantastic creators.</p>
