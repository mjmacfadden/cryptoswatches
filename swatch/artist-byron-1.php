        <h1>Artist Byron</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you(who are you, what do you do professionally or otherwise, where are you located in the world)?</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Byron. I&rsquo;m a Canadian artist living in rural Manitoba. I have been creating art for a long time, but in 2009 is when I would say my art career began.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this project?</strong></p>
        <p>My inspiration for most pieces is spontaneity. I have never really gotten the hang of preplanning something. I never got used to preliminary sketches and lots of tries. I just go hard and keep at it until it&rsquo;s done.<br />I don&rsquo;t actually create digital art. All my art is hand drawn with pens or straight up painted. I don&rsquo;t like the UNDO button.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>When I began my art career I was poor and trying to support my new family. So art supplies have always been a &lsquo;use whatever i got&rsquo; type event. Dollarstore&nbsp;supplies are good enough if you&rsquo;re not fussy. It&rsquo;s all about the creation, not the high price of equipment. Plus it&rsquo;s really easy to tear through all the paint and paper if you know it won&rsquo;t cost hundreds of dollars to replace. A pack of gel pens for 2 bucks. Yes please.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic/photographic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been influenced by everything and everyone. The good and the bad. Artistically though, comic greats like McFarlane and TV celebs like Ernie Coombs is where I got my early start.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I got into crypto by chance and lack of understanding. My half brother Nathan Rempel messaged me one day saying he needed art. Lots of art. So &hellip; I dumped hundreds of pieces of art on him and then learned WTF NFTs are.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online (Twitter, website, Instagram, OpenSea, Rarible, etc?)</strong><br />I am on Twitter as&nbsp;<a title="@ArtistByron" href="https://twitter.com/ArtistByron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ArtistByron</a>&nbsp;and on telegram&nbsp;<a title="T.me/byronsroom&nbsp;" href="https://cryptoswatches.com/artistbyron/T.me/byronsroom%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T.me/byronsroom&nbsp;</a><br />I&rsquo;m elsewhere, like youtube and stuff, but seldom these days.</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>The original painting is 2.5&Prime;x3.5&Prime; mixed media on paper and will go on sale the day after our collaboration. It will also include a 1/1 unanimated NFT of this image.</p>
