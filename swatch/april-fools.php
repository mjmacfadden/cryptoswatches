        <h1>The 1st of April</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p>NFTs are super cool. There&rsquo;s no denying that, but it can be easy to start taking things too seriously. As such, we conducted a poll a few days ago to see how the greater community would feel about an April Fool&rsquo;s Day NFT. Well, the people voted and the results were overwhelmingly in favor.</p>        <p>So, we&rsquo;ve created the first prank NFT that we are releasing for free on April 1st&mdash;also known as April Fools&rsquo; Day. Our hope is that this becomes an annual reminder to keep things light and fun.</p>
        <p>Since you&rsquo;re reading this, you are cool and on the inside. The QR Code directs you to a hidden page on our site that each year will feature a new gag. This year, you get Rick Rolled when you visit.</p>
        <p>You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>
        <p>One last thing: according to&nbsp;<a href="https://tiphero.com/birth-month-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TipHero</a>&nbsp;(whatever that is), cayenne is &ldquo;the color of April.&rdquo;</p>
