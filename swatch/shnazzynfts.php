        <h1>SHNAZZYNFTS</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers and tell us about this piece:</strong></p>
        <p>Thank you for this opportunity CryptoSwatch!</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m Shnazzy, a 26 year old mother of three very young and excitable boys and a passionate artist. Only recently have I practiced bettering my digital art craft. For years I predominantly considered myself a water color painter, but after my second son was born, having accessible art supplies around just caused more mess and headache.</p>
        <p>I actually bought my first iPad at the beginning of the pandemic! I downloaded the procreate software and got to start figuring out the quick access features available. After about a year, I found myself thoroughly engaged with the retail revolution happening around the stocks $AMC and $GME. The retail investors rallied behind saving the companies from malicious short sellers who were trying to bankrupt them, and I had the idea to start making art to represent and educate outsiders about the movement. The creators were adored and it was recommended to me that I should put them into the blockchain, and that&rsquo;s how I found myself getting into NFTs!</p>
        <p>This particular piece is more of a sci-fi landscape that was created out of a love for world building. My current project on WAX is a book released chapter by chapter in the discord alongside of poster style NFTs! My next drop will have a more landscape approach so I wanted to practice my techniques.</p>
