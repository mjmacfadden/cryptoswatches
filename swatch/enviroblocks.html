        <h1>Enviroblocks</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>Hi, my name is Emptor (definitely not a real name). That&rsquo;s Latin for &ldquo;Buyer&rdquo;. My twitter handle, &ldquo;empt_vx&rdquo;, the vx stands for vfx or special effects. So in short, even though i am an artist, I am&nbsp;also a collector at heart (i&rsquo;ll buy your art if i like them!). In real life i also collect playing cards, enamel pins, art prints, you name it. My real name is Fadhil, and Professionally, i am a Creative Director / Graphic Designer at my Creative Agency here in Jakarta, Indonesia. I also run a streetwear brand with some of my buddies.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>About my collection, Enviroblocks, it is an&nbsp;NFT collectible based upon the idea of collectible &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; of cities, environments, people, and objects. You can say it&rsquo;s also inspired by Legos. I like the idea of how people can use their imagination in placing these building blocks and making a city of their own, in their head, imagining scenes, by looking at my building blocks.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I have been designing graphics and making physical&nbsp;art in different forms for over a decade.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>About my work flow, especially with enviroblocks, I usually imagine the bigger picture first, and then narrow it down to several smaller, much more detailed ideas regarding the building. For example, currently, the &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; that is on enviroblocks is the &ldquo;Future&rdquo; timeline, so i try to imagine first how would the future be? is it going to be post-apocalyptic? or will humanity thrive? if it was post apocalyptic, where would people go to work? how does their transportation runs? is it gas? is it water? After i&rsquo;ve narrowed down my ideas, i look for inspirations from all over the internet, but usually, i already had a rough idea of what i was looking for. For my original art style i mainly uses Blender , Illustrator, and Photoshop, but for enviroblocks, i&rsquo;m using magicavoxel.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>My Artistic influence changes from time to time, but for now, i&rsquo;m very inspired by Beeple. Also, MadMaraca, she is one hell of a voxel artist, she&rsquo;s the reason i went back to learn more about magicavoxel since i didn&rsquo;t know voxel art can look that pretty. I can&rsquo;t name each one of them, but i bookmarked a ton of really great NFTs on twitter, that i always&nbsp;go back to from time to time to&nbsp;draw inspirations from. Oh and the graphics on Bitcoin Origins? Jeez.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I started out as a crypto trader first, forced by my friend who made fortune in the space, but i couldn&rsquo;t find success in trading as i got what you might call &ldquo;Paper Hands&rdquo; hahaha. Then i tried becoming a DeFi degen, also no success. Then i found out that there are games on the blockchain that can earn you real money, with tradable tokens called NFTs, so i started playing games. I mean, nothing to lose, i also play games on a daily basis. It was mind blowing for me to discover, as with regular games you&rsquo;re technically not allowed to buy and sell in-game items, but in NFT gaming they&rsquo;re actually encouraging you to do it! It took me a few blockchain exploration (and some plenty of gas fees) until i finally landed on WAX. Nowadays i only spent my time on WAX, and as daytime jobs prevents me from playing too many games (much busier now than several months ago) i chose to make my own collectible instead, as it&rsquo;s therapeutic for me and distracts me from the pressure of my daily life. If people wanted to buy my art, that&rsquo;s a bonus. I&rsquo;m happy enough to be able to create. I also try to buy some NFTs that i really like on WAX, just to keep them in my wallet forever hahaha.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <div>Online you can find me on:</div>
        <div>Twitter:&nbsp;@empt_vx</div>
        <div>Real life Instagram:&nbsp;@fadhilthrq (the one with the GPK as a display picture)</div>
        <div>Enviroblocks&nbsp;twitter:&nbsp;@<wbr />enviroblocks</div>
        <div>I also mint on bsc&rsquo;s airnfts:&nbsp;<a href="https://app.airnfts.com/creators/0x48d02c421DF013708f5E5a9CcB28182efc4a9de4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://app.airnfts.com/creators/0x48d02c421DF013708f5E5a9CcB28182efc4a9de4&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620560166367000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHc647ndOy0ao3EnxZphdkMiRHkaQ">https://app.airnfts.<wbr />com/creators/<wbr />0x48d02c421DF013708f5E5a9CcB28<wbr />182efc4a9de4</a></div>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;d like to share that in the near future i will also be making another collectible based upon my personal art style, a mix of 3d and 2d digital painting instead of 3d animated voxel like enviroblocks. Do be on the lookout for more enviroblocks and my new collections! Also, if you&rsquo;re interested in making your own collection on WAX but lack the technical skills such as making the graphics itself, do send me a DM on twitter and maybe we can work something out ;).</p>
        <div>
        <div>
        <p>Lastly, kudos to my friend Bols for supporting enviroblocks&nbsp;from the beginning and putting the pressure on me to make more enviroblocks! You know who you are buddy! hahaha.</p>

        <div>Thank you for the opportunity, Mike &amp; the Cryptoswatches&nbsp;team!</div>
