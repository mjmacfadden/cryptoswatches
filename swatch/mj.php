        <h1>MJ</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m MJ, from the Philippines. I&rsquo;m a frustrated writer who loves to blog about random stuff on read.cash, a crypto-blogging platform that lets you earn Bitcoin cash. I am also a furmom of 5 dogs that I consider as my own children. ðŸ™‚</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>Honestly, this piece here was never part of the plan. My first concept was to highlight my 2019 drawings. I only got a few pieces but when I showed them to a friend, he then encouraged me to join NFT and who knows, I could earn something from it in the future.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the first collection was rejected and so, I was advised by a friend I met on the Telegram channel to create another one. Then I suddenly got the idea of minting my own selfies but with a twist. So instead of showing my real face, I used an app to make it look like an anime. Besides, I find this concept unique since no one has ever done this before, posting an anime version of themselves.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I started minting in March but stopped recently due to some health issues.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>Okay, so there&rsquo;s nothing fancy about my NFTs. For this piece, I only used an app called Snow, where one of its features can turn your ordinary photos into cartoons. I super like it because I&rsquo;m a big fan of anime when I was younger.</p>
        <p>Aside from this app, I also used Canva and PicsArt to add extra filters. Sadly, I only rely on photo editor apps and never tried Adobe or those other fancy software you guys use.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>I would say @bm8ter. He is a friend I met online and also the same guy who introduced me to NFT. When I showed him some of my drawings, he urged me to try minting them and earn WAX. He&rsquo;s good at making memes and editing stuff.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>At first, I had zero knowledge about NFTs until @bm8ter mentioned this to me several times, as well as my other friend, @Sadu0ne aka PVM. When I tried it for the first time, they both sent me cute NFTs, which I super love and are still in my wallet up to now. Since then, I keep collecting NFTs. I love NFTs because it reminds me of the traditional cards my brother and I used to collect when we were just kids.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m active on Twitter and Telegram. I have Instagram, but I don&rsquo;t use it anymore. Anyway, just search @bmjc98 on both Twitter and Telegram, and you will find me there. ðŸ™‚</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share</strong></p>
        <p>I just want to take this opportunity to thank you for this. I honestly didn&rsquo;t expect to be noticed by you, like for real! When you asked me about the artwork, I thought you just wanted to tell me that you got one of those. But when you offered me a collab, I was really shocked. I didn&rsquo;t expect that an artist like you would offer me something like this, so THANK YOU.&nbsp;</p>
