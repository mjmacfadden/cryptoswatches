        <h1>MAMMOTHMYTHICS</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>We are Jack Colclough and Jake O&rsquo;Connor and we are both the Co-Founders of Mammoth Mythics. We are two friends from the Midlands who were inspired by the countless opportunities within the Crypto and NFT space!</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>The inspiration for the Kamastikra project came from firstly, our sense of humour. As the industry was (and still is) in its infancy and has developed a somewhat &lsquo;memey&rsquo; culture, we knew this would be the perfect concept. Furthermore, this was an opportunity to link in the Ancient Indian Sanskrit, Kama Sutra, and thus KamaStikra was born.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>We started operating and creating within the digital realm back in the middle of 2021 and after building a solid community, released our first drop of Kamastikra project in November 2021.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>Answer from our lead designer, Soapy Grenade: It&rsquo;s your typical artistic process, sketch, lines and flat colours, finish off with shading and effects! Of course, references are close at hand for the odder drawings!</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Answer from our lead designer, Soapy Grenade: Can&rsquo;t point at anyone or anything specific, which is a pain for when I&rsquo;m having trouble sketching something out, but I do reference cell shading artists and those with a more cartoony art style to make sure my work remains fluid and lively!</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>We (Co-Founders) have both been interested in cryptocurrency for a number of years and have built a portfolio over time, nevertheless the interest has always stemmed from what the technology can do for people as opposed to from an investor perspective.</p>
