        <h1>NFTALLEYCAT</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hey how&rsquo;s it going? I am NFTAlleyCat, or &ldquo;Catarax&rdquo;, and I am the Creator of the CryptoCrypt &amp; TeneInfernum Collections. I&rsquo;m from Los Angeles and have been creating Artwork for 8 years now.</p>
        <p>The CryptoCrypt houses NFTs with Individual Lore, Tying into the overlying Realm of the Collection: Netheros. As well, I have started a 1 of 1 Series of Cat Familiars called &ldquo;Nekos&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>I was inspired heavily by imagery within Dante&rsquo;s Inferno, and the Video Game Elden Ring. Tie that in with the Lore I create currently in the Crypt, and it creates a beautifully macabre scene.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>My digital art journey has only recently started, with a good portion of my beginning pieces in the CryptoCrypt being Physical Artworks, Scanned and Edited to create the finished product. I had dabbled a little bit in Digital Mediums beforehand, but had not felt I was ready at that point to make the leap.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>I use an iPad Pro, Apple Pencil Gen 1, with Procreate. As for the Brush Packs I use Grit Texture Supply now for mostly everything, and have modified them a bit to my liking.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Artistic Influences I would have to say are Junji Ito &amp; Jamie Hewlett</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I found NFTs last March, after a Live Demo by @LushSux on Instagram/Twitter.<br />I got hooked instantly after a heavy night of research and a rabbit hole of articles.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>You can find all of my work on AtomicHub &amp; Neftyblocks. CryptoCrypt2 (Whitelisted) + TeneInfernum (In the Process of WL)</p>
