        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hey fam, I&rsquo;m Eric MindMaster! I am an artist, a husband and a father! I love to draw, write, make music, and skateboard! I also have a regular 9-5, working in insurance! I am located in South Florida, the melting pot of the world!</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>I love to snack, but I try to show restraint! These are all the things I love to eat on cheat days! I also found out our collab was happening on National Junk Food Day! So that immediately gave me an image and I went for it!</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s been years! I went to the Art Institute in 2003, so a lot of PhotoShop and Adobe Illustrator work! I started a family, so my digital art took a backseat to my hand drawn pieces. Then I started on my smart phone in November 2020, when I had my Note 8 with the stylus. I was using autodesk at that time. My wife gave me an iPad for Christmas that year so I&rsquo;ve been in love with Procreate ever since!</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>I usually sketch up my pieces on whatever sketchbook, notebook, scrap, napkin, etc. I have nearby while the idea is fresh. I use whatever writing device I have nearby. I like my classic wooden #2 pencils the best for sketching, it&rsquo;s nostalgic. I like to make photo copies and then try different color ideas with color pencil or marker! I take a pic with my phone or iPad and load it into Procreate to finish it up!</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>That&rsquo;s a hard question! I love Britto&rsquo;s paintings, they are so clean and the colors pop! Andrea McKenzie is another artist I love! Her art is just amazing! I really like anime, so there&rsquo;s not many of them whose work I don&rsquo;t love!</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>All of the above! I was so excited when I saw the 1st NFT artwork! I have been learning about and trying my hand at investing in the crypto space for a while! Landed on $WAX and have never looked back!</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m on all main streaming apps! Twitter is where I&rsquo;m mostly active! My handle is eric_mindmaster on all of them! I&rsquo;m on IG, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram, Discord, etc. All my links can be found here:</p>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>I love how the WaxFam comes together and continues to foster a peaceful and creativity focused community! I couldn&rsquo;t be happier to be a part of the conversation!</p>
