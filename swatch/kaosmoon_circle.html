        <h1>KAOSMOON_CIRCLE</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m David Boller and I was born in Zurich, Switzerland. After college, I move to the USA to work for Marvel Comics and many others. I stayed in New Jersey until 2008, when I move back to Switzerland to create my own publishing company Virtual Graphics. I wrote, drew and published over 32 graphic novels in 10 years but eventually moved on to animation and Web3 development. All my experience is coming in very handy in creating unique projects that are fun to play but also pretty to look at.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>This unpublished and exclusive image shows the Kaos Moon in the very detailed style I used in the graphic novel series. Her look combines tribal and Native American elements which all adds to her otherworldly and mysterious look.</p>
        <p>Kaos Moon: Into the Burning Circle is an occult project. A long time ago, the mountains of Siberia were ruled by clans of powerful Shamans. Three of them. Varg, Shrasa and Kaos Moon are still alive in spirit form and are locked in a deadly battle for revenge. Their link to the real world is the Russian medium Katja Zakkov and her brother Jules. Help them defend our reality from Shamans, mythological creatures and ancient gods.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>Is started creating digital art in 1998 with Photoshop 4 and a Wacom tablet. I then added Painter which I used until about 2002. But due to its poor editing capabilities and the more varied brushes in Photoshop, I dropped Painter.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>I have been using mostly the Adobe Creative Suite for 2D art, Toon Boom Harmony for animation and Blender for 3D. For video production I use After Effects, Unreal Engine 5 and Premiere and for games I use mostly Unity. For Web3 app development I use Visual Studio Code, Figma, Adobe XD, react and several Web3 providers like Moralis, Thirdweb and Alchemy.<br />All on Windows since I&rsquo;m a disgruntled Apple user.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Artistic influence come from many different areas, such as comic books, anime, film, music etc. In terms of artwork, there were early influences of some of the greatest comic book artists like Moebius, Barry Windsor Smith, P.G. Russel, Windsor McCay, Hal Foster, Alex Toth and too many to count. But equally important are the influences from anime studios like Studio Madhouse, Satoshi Kon, Ghibli as well as many bands. I&rsquo;m mostly a fan of prog rock, fusion, some metal and world and new age music. It&rsquo;s all one big canvas.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I was always interested in crypto but NFTs were the perfect bridge to get involved with my projects. Since then I&rsquo;ve stepped up my dev game and my horizon has expanded exponentially. I don&rsquo;t see NFTs as just collectibles anymore, but truly dynamic digital assets that are fun to collect and use in many gamefi projects. We&rsquo;re just at the very beginning and every new day brings new ideas for utility.</p>
