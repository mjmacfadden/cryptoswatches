        <h1>Dem Cute Frens</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hi there! My nickname on the Internet is WizzO, Wizzle or WizzoTheGreenCat. I&rsquo;m a 3D generalist based in Barcelona and I&rsquo;ve been working as a freelancer for some time now. I&rsquo;ve worked mostly doing ArchViz, product design, advertisement and some assets for videogames. My works were always focused on photorealism, but lately I&rsquo;ve decided that I wanted to do some cartoonish stuff because I needed a change. This is why I decided to do cute NFTs, for fun and because I love cute things.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>There are many artists who inspire me, Instagram is a great source of inspiration for me. I really admire the works of wood.youmind and nguyen.nhut.art to name a few. I follow a lot of artists out there that I like and they give me ideas. Regarding this piece, my inspiration came from movie films like Bugs and of course, from nature, which is the great fountain of inspiration and creativity for me.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I would say I started doing digital art since I was a child. I remember being 5 years old and doing stuff with the first versions of a &ldquo;Paint&rdquo; software and then with the early versions of Photoshop. I always enjoyed drawing and watching cartoons, so for me being able to create characters and stories was a blessing. However, it wasn&rsquo;t since I was 22 years old that I decided to do a 3D animation online course and I&rsquo;ve been working doing 3D since then.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>The first 3D software that I learned was Autodesk 3D Max and I mostly used it for work since I discovered Blender (this was about 3 years ago and I almost never went back to 3D Max). I like Blender a lot because it&rsquo;s free, easy to use and has a lot of tools (although some of them still need improvement). Besides that I also use a lot of software like ZBrush for sculpting, Substance Painter for doing textures, Unity for videogames and lastly, Adobe Photoshop for retouching images and Adobe Premier for video editing (which I still use for my NFTs).</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Besides the two artists mentioned above, and thinking more of my general influences, I would say: Studio Ghibli films (or Hayao Miyazaki), Katsuhiro Otomo, Akira Toriyama, Pixar / Disney movies and Japanese anime in general. I&rsquo;m also a big fan of comics and I could name a few great artists like Moebius, Frank Frazetta, Bill Sienkiewicz, Kevin O&rsquo;Neill or J.H. Williams III. But most of these are not inspirations for my NFTs, just artists whom I admire.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I follow a guy named BlenderGuru on Youtube; who has a series of tutorials and podcasts relating to 3D. Comments regarding Beeple&rsquo;s crazy sales on Nifty Gateway and how the NFT marketplaces were allowing 3D artists to sell their work struck a chord with me. I was already trying to sell some of my models online, but I had never sold anything to be honest, so I thought, &ldquo;maybe I should try this NFT thing?&rdquo;. This is how I started looking for marketplaces but the &ldquo;famous&rdquo; ones were quite expensive and hard to get in. Luckily, I finally found the WAX ecosystem and started collecting stuff there. A month later I did my first NFT and this is when my journey in this nice community began.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>You can find my social media accounts here:&nbsp;<a title="https://bio.link/demcutefrens" href="https://bio.link/demcutefrens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bio.link/demcutefrens</a>. Also I plan to start streaming on Twitch soon (things like Marble races and also me creating some NFTs), I&rsquo;ll add the link there when everything is ready.</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>Just my love and appreciation for all the artists that helped me so far and also the collectors that keep cheering me up and who are my greatest motivation to keep doing NFTs. Also a big shout out to Apple from The World of Cryptopups for giving me the opportunity to participate in that amazing collab that we did for the Uplift (<a title="https://nftinsider.io/uniteforuplift/" href="https://nftinsider.io/uniteforuplift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nftinsider.io/uniteforuplift/</a>) with such amazing artists. I just love this community and I&rsquo;m very thankful for everyone&rsquo;s support ðŸ™‚</p>
