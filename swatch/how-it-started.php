        <h1>How It Started</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>How It Started:</strong></p>
        <p>It seems hard to believe that only one year has gone by since I minted my first NFT under the &ldquo;cryptoswatch&rdquo; collection on the WAX blockchain. Who would have guessed back in March of 2021, that those incredibly simple, solid color swatches would evolve into what the project has become&mdash;a collaborative platform that showcases indie NFT projects and artists from all over the world with 9,000 followers on Twitter (and counting)?</p>
        <p>When I <a href="https://x.com/MJMacfadden/status/1366498912522100744?s=20&amp;amp;t=Fj85SndJpycDV_Df0-R-wQ" target="_blank">first tweeted</a> about the project, from my personal Twitter account, I was shocked that anyone even noticed. So you can imagine my surprise when in under 24 hours all 100 NFTs had been claimed. Keep in mind this was before I even knew that programmatic drops existed, so I had to manually transfer each NFT from Atomic Hub one at a time.</p>
        <p>To commemorate this amazing, and in many ways life changing, year, I have tokenized the original tweet (featured below) as a cryptoswatch. Own a little piece of history from this corner of web3 by minting your own, and if you&rsquo;ve been with us from the beginning, you might want to blend your way towards an ultra rare, glimmering black version.</p>
        <p><strong>And One More Thing:</strong></p>
