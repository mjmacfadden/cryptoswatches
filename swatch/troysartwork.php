        <h1>TROYS ARTWORK</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers :</strong></p>
        <p>hey everyone! my name is Troy and i&rsquo;m from central Canada.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>my project is about creation and connection! its meaningful for me to connect with other creative minds through artwork. i have a deep love for creating artwork, focused mostly on cats and the natural world.</p>
        <p>this piece titled Onyx Eve was inspired by the colours and atmosphere of spooky season! it was sketched out with pencil first, and then outlined in ink. i then painted in water colour, and added the finishing touches with pencil crayons.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>i have been creating in the digital world for almost a year now.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>all of my artwork is traditional, and i tend to use ink and pencil crayon to create my artworks. i then take photos of each piece with my phone, and that is also where i do all of my editing. once the editing is finalized i upload to my PC where i drop my pieces!</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>my father Byron the Artist has been a huge artistic influence in my life, as well as all of the lovely creators i follow and see on twitter! my father also inspired my interest in creating NFTs.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>you can find my twitter @troysartwork</p>
        <p>and you can find my atomichub and neftyblocks @troysartwork !!</p>
