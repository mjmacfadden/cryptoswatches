            <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
            <p>Hey guys! Whats up! SO I guess Im known &ldquo;professionally&rdquo; in the industry as Muenster or MuensterVision&hellip; Though I never shy away from just being myself, Ian. I am an avid music lover, I am a proud papa and a fulfilled husband, I love all things human, to communion, and to eat all the &lsquo;Za! I was born and raised in Austin, Texas (USA). I now live with my radiant wife and &lsquo;lil baby girl in Rockwall, Texas (Near Dallas).</p>
            <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
            <p>So &ldquo;We Live&rdquo; is a recent exclusive mix/cut from my upcoming LP MuensterVision Presents: Ian.</p>
            <p>This is a very open an honest piece about the importance and energy surrounding being in the here and now with the moments we get in time. They are so fleeting, and we are here for just a blip of time. So often we get caught up in what once was or what is yet to occur, we fail to recognize all the magic of each moment that is occurring around us. I wanted to take the time to honor that phenom. &ldquo;What are we here for? We must wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
            <p>Geez&hellip; I suppose I have been recording and releasing works digitally for almost two decades now, starting out on sites like SoundClick, or MySpace and then pivoting to SoundCloud, and then BandCamp, then streaming, and well now were here: a THREE PART cross community collab that is taking token backed assets and combining them with art and music and mechanics, and crafting&hellip;its just&hellip; truly awesome. Is it not ?</p>
            <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
            <p>Sure&hellip; So a lot of button smashers, that my favorite. I have had a Yamahars7000 for 20 years, I have a Roland Juno G synth, A Rhodes Mark II, and a slew of other synths. I also record all of my compositions on Cubase or Ableton LIVE when I&rsquo;m not in my home away from home: Valley of the Kings music studios where all of the record has been recorded, including &ldquo;We Live.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
            <p>I have so many. It&rsquo;s really hard to quantify. So, I&rsquo;d say I am moved by movements themselves. The electric explosion of Jazz Fusion and Beatnik poetry. The birth of call and response &ldquo;toasting&rdquo; by the Jamaican and Caribbean communities in New York in the Bronx coupled with the racial and socioeconomic disparity that birthed modern day RAP music, while spots like the good life cafe in LA were birthing some of the greatest MC&rsquo;s, story tellers, and musicians the world would have to offer.</p>
            <p>I am HIGHLY influenced/inspired by West Coast underground hip hop from the mid 90&rsquo;s. This is facts.</p>
            <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
            <p>Man &lsquo;o man. This is a whole separate interview, ha! TL/DR: The notion of token backed asset management, generational royalties, and artist sovereignty was like the largest lightbulb ever, going off all at once. I could see EVERYTHING&hellip; ALL the ad infinitum of possibility!</p>
            <p>Where can we find you online/</p>
            <p>I am EVERYWHERE:</p>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
            <p>We are only here once, in these skin suits of ours, experiencing things only once over&hellip; be good to each other, go carpe some diem!</p>
            <p>Peace and manifestations!</p>
