        <h1>Humble Drawing</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>HumbleDrawing&acute;s is a team consisting of brother and sister S&aacute;ra and Kenneth.<br />S&aacute;ra is the main artist, and mainly makes traditional physical art pieces, Kenneth is the &ldquo;tech guy&rdquo; and sometimes makes digital specials of our original pieces.<br />We are based in Denmark, but have roots in the Faroe Islands.<br />S&aacute;ra is working full time as a nurse, and has been drawing and painting on a hobby basis for most of her life. Kenneth works full time as a fabricator/welder</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>A lot of the inspiration either comes spontaneously or from the beauty in the nature all around us, this shows up on quite a few of our released pieces, and is the case for this humble Buttercup flower as well.<br />Even if it might be considered just to be weeds by some, it still holds a ton of beauty</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>We have been NFT&acute;s for right about six months at this point, for S&aacute;ra it&acute;s over 25 years of drawing and painting on a hobby basis</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>For our physical pieces it varies which paints and canvases are used, a lot of pieces are made on canvas with acrylic and other types of paints, also a lot of pieces are made on paper also with different paints, watercolors etc.<br />Most of the materials are from the local hobbyist store, not always the top of the line stuff, but there isn&acute;t really a need for using expensive things to obtain amazing results.<br />For the digital pieces we make, we have been using GIMP and After Effects, Kenneth has recently embarked upon the journey of learning Blender as well, as we&acute;d love to make some more animated pieces in the future.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>It&acute;s very tough to pinpoint any single artist, there are simply just so many talented artists and creators in the space, it&acute;s almost daily we stumble upon someone who makes something amazing, different or somehow not seen before.<br />The easy answer would be to say nature, as it really does have a big influence on some of our pieces</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>Kenneth has been in crypto on and off since 2010, and the interest for NFT&acute;s spiked back in late January this year as it was mentioned by a friend what NFT&acute;s were, Kenneth started looking into WAX, and began collecting different NFT&acute;s.<br />And with the knowledge that S&aacute;ra loves making art, I suggested that we could try to make her artwork into NFT&acute;s, and here we are ðŸ™‚</p>
        <p>Where can we find you online?</p>
        <p>We currently don&acute;t have a website running, but we do have a domain linking directly to our collection on AtomicHub</p>
        <p>Collection Link:<br />https://humbledrawings.com<br />Twitter:<br /><a title="https://twitter.com/humbledrawing" href="https://twitter.com/humbledrawing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/humbledrawing</a><br />Discord:<br /><a title="https://discord.gg/P7MWFmVPAs" href="https://discord.gg/P7MWFmVPAs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/P7MWFmVPAs</a><br />Telegram:<br /><a title="https://t.me/humledrawing" href="https://t.me/humledrawing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://t.me/humledrawing</a></p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>We are very close to dropping our first redeemable NFT&acute;s, these will be in form of a 3D printed Lithophanes, the first ones will be of our HumbleHouses No. 1.<br />The lithophanes will be at a limited amount and each one will have it&acute;s own unique Mint # engraved right in there. This is something Kenneth has been working on for some time now, and we&acute;re very close to satisfied with the results</p>
