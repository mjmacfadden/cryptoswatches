        <h1>Armies of Power</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you(who are you, what do you do professionally or otherwise, where are you located in the world)?</strong></p>
        <p>Hey Crypto Swatch community.&nbsp;We are Armies of Power.&nbsp;We are a small team of creators, developers, crypto enthusiasts and nerdy gamers at heart.&nbsp;We are located in the US and Canada.</p>
        <p>Armies of Power is a competitive, collectible trading card NFT project built on the WAX blockchain.&nbsp;Our mission was to create a military themed set of NFTs with an added layer of interactivity, making our NFTs more than just static collectibles.&nbsp;Our NFTs fall into 2 categories, Playable and Collectible.&nbsp;On the playable side the goal is to amass a powerful army of troops, vehicles and other assets, contributing to your power score and if you&rsquo;re powerful enough a spot on our top 100 leaderboard.&nbsp;Through the use of blending we promote the burning of lower tier assets which result in a new NFT rewarding the player with a higher power score.&nbsp;Our collectibles are a set of limited quantity NFTs obtained through our lore-based missions and side quests as well as our leaderboard reward system.</p>
        <p>We employ Mint Sprints, Burn to Earn, Leaderboard Rewards and some really incredible lore.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this project?</strong></p>
        <p>We&rsquo;re a mix of creative and crypto enthusiasts who grew up playing games like Ghost Recon, Call of Duty, Battlefield etc. We decided to take all those passions and mash them up into a cool project we could share on the WAX blockchain.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<strong>How long have you been working on this project?</strong></p>
        <p>Armies of Power launched in April of this year.&nbsp;We are currently in Season 1 and are at Tier 4 of our 11 Tier release scheduled for this season.&nbsp;See our roadmap for additional dates and upcoming features.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.armiesofpower.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.armiesofpower.com/roadmap&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624127849831000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsjA0APVcS_iFdBNsxis2Y5jSNBQ">https://www.<wbr />armiesofpower.com/roadmap</a></p>
        <p><strong>Can you give us some behind the scenes info about the project (workflow, other ideas you didn&rsquo;t pursue, tools you use, etc)?</strong></p>
        <p>We spent a surprising amount of time working on the mechanics and balance of the cards.&nbsp;We ran simulations and what/if scenarios for consumers entering the project at every tier and playing through to the end of the season.&nbsp;In the end it&rsquo;s all math but we wanted to be sure our community was rewarded with higher power and more valuable NFTs as they burned their way to the top no matter where they started.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What games/projects/artists have influenced your work?</strong></p>
        <p>Coming from gaming backgrounds our influences are largely from video game designers.&nbsp;Right now the guys from Wardog Collective come to mind from an artist standpoint.</p>
        <p>Early on we discovered a project that simply blended numbered balls for a more scarce, higher number ball. It was incredibly simple and boring yet you wanted to keep pushing to be the first to get to the highest number. We really love the mechanics of blending assets to return a new asset. There is a lot you can do with that from a creative perspective. There are so many great projects out there but we think we have something really unique with Armies of Power.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles/Crypto Gaming?</strong></p>
        <p>We began with some investments in crypto currency. That led us to WAX and we started exploring the NFT space.&nbsp;As long time gamers who have dropped countless dollars on in-game assets that had no re-sale market we loved the idea of ownership and a thriving secondary marketplace for digital assets.&nbsp;There were some gaps in what was being offered from both a design and functionality aspect.&nbsp;Along came Armies of Power to fill some of those gaps.&nbsp;</p>
