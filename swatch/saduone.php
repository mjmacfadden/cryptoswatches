        <h1>SADU ONE</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Paul but the Metaverse knows me as PV or PVM. I started as a crypto content creator on Publish0x, and<br />expanded on many other platforms. I share my time between Romania and the UK, as any place with internet is a good<br />place to live.</p>
        <p>I entered the cryptoworld in 2015, when I bought and sold some Bitcoin. Took a break between 2017 and 2020, when I<br />made my comeback! Since March 2020 I published an article every day, heading towards a 1000 consecutive days<br />streak.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>Harvest Finance was the first DeFi project I tried, and the &ldquo;humble farmers&rdquo; movement made me explore decentralized<br />finance even more. The tractor I used for Humble Tractors (<a title="https://opensea.io/collection/humble-tractors" href="https://opensea.io/collection/humble-tractors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://opensea.io/collection/humble-tractors</a>) exists IRL,<br />and was my source of inspiration for many creativity contests. I wanted to make it live forever on the blockchain and<br />minted it as my first collection on Opensea. Funny enough, my first NFT on WAX was also Harvest Finance related.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I created some NFTs on WAX just for fun since 2021, as a way to try my skills or to mark various events. I created the<br />blockstars21 collection (https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/collection/blockstars21) and minted NFTs and shared them as<br />rewards for competitions or giveaways, a concept that is similar to what POAP is now.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t use any software for my creations, using only paper, pencils and colours. I feel that this is the original indie way,<br />something that makes my work both unique and special.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Definitely Byron! I know my way around with a pencil but watching his videos and understanding his style made me<br />learn some tricks of the trade.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I was &ldquo;corrupted&rdquo; by NFTs instantly, as the young PVM had an impressive collection of Panini albums, stickers and<br />other collectibles. I had so many stickers from gums, including Garbage Pale Kids and Turbo cars, so the NFT concept<br />was mind blowing. It all started with one CryptomonKey and one Byron NFT, back in 2021, and it went all the way to<br />over 5000 NFTs on WAX, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and SmartBCH.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
