        <h1>NFTNoob23</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers?</strong></p>
        <p>My Name is Chris, founder and creator for Levitated Arts &amp; the @emodicons generative project on OpenSea.io. I&rsquo;m a full time artist from the Midwest (Chicago area) and primarily focus on the NFT space. 6 months ago I decided to leave my day job, and per-sue a career in the Art industry. This was probably the best decision I&rsquo;ve ever made!</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>My inspiration for this piece is my brand I&rsquo;m currently growing the Levitated Society.<br />A place where artist and collectors can come together and grow amongst one another.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve actually been creating religiously in the digital realm now for about 7 months!<br />Day in and day out I don&rsquo;t take many breaks and you can see the growth in my craft in my website I will list below.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>My base images by hand using procreate, and my Apple Pencil.<br />Then animations are done through other software on my laptop such as photoshop and a few other platforms!</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I exactly have an artistic influence, the way I work is mainly off of inspiration, if I see something or have an idea I just try to turn those thoughts into fruition. Not saying I don&rsquo;t enjoy others work but life, nature, just the everyday world is art to me.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>About 7 months ago my uncle was telling me about NBA TopShot and was telling me to get involved and not knowing much about the whole &ldquo;NFT&rdquo; or crypto-Verse. I&rsquo;d say I was skeptical at first then. One day I decided to invest into street fighters on the WAX blockchain and haven&rsquo;t looked back since really&hellip; I made one sale and decided to buy an iPad and pick back up my hobby of art that had since been lost due to everyday life.</p>
