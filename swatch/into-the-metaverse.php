        <h1>Into The Metaverse</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>About this piece:</strong></p>
        <p>Back in November of 2021, @ArtistByron posted <a href="https://x.com/ArtistByron/status/1459732432098365443" target="_blank">an image</a> of a sketch that was decidedly early in its progress. In the moment, he didn&rsquo;t know exactly what it would become. Later in the day though, he posted a reply to reveal that it had become a kickass eyeball skull (no surprise there), but before he had made his big reveal, I began to think about what it could be too.</p>
        <p>To me, it looked like a wormhole into another dimension&mdash;one we now openly call &ldquo;the metaverse.&rdquo; Without his permission, I used his sketch as the launching point for the digital collage featured in this collab.</p>
        <p>Being the good guy that he is, he later agreed to have let me use his work in this piece AND agreed to sanction this collaboration. If you didn&rsquo;t know already, the #WAXFam is the best.</p>
        <p>On a personal note, I also used this piece as an excuse to brush up on my motion graphics skills using Adobe After Effects.</p>
        <p>Share your work with the world, even if it&rsquo;s only half baked, your journey into the metaverse starts with your first step.</p>
        <p>In addition to the sketch by @ArtistByron, the assets featured in this collab are available at the links below.</p>
