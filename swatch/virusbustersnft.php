        <h1>VIRUSBUSTERSNFT</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hello there! Who are we? We are Bakerboy &amp; Wilouche, creators of Virus Busters!</p>
        <p>We are two French Canadians who met at the university, while completing a bachelor in graphic design. As soon as we met, WE KNEW we had a lot of things in common. We went to a lot of comedy nights together, had many drinks, and also gamed quite a bit back then, we played a lot of Overwatch. We&rsquo;ve known each other for the past 6 years and counting! We are glad to be working on this project together, it keeps us connected!</p>
        <p>We are both working professionally in the field of graphic design and we have been wanting to create a project on the Wax blockchain for a long time. It was really important for us to have fun creating the project, this is 100% a passion project and we wanted to be both happy with our visuals and concept before going further with a collection.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>Wormy is one of the first viruses we created in the collection. It helped to set the tone of our collection and where we&rsquo;re going with our content. We love to bring some wacky and uncanny vibe to our creations. We have an unwritten rule, if it makes us laugh, it passes the test. When this little guy was born, we knew he was gonna be a big part of our collection.<br />This specific version of Wormy was created specifically for the Crypto Swatch X Virusbusters collab!</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>We&rsquo;ve been doing some digital work unrelated to NFTs in the past, but about 6 months ago, we started seriously thinking about creating our own NFT collection. We had (and still have) many ideas, but we really enjoyed the concept of Virus Busters so we started thinking about the general concept, the name, branding, and the underlying mechanics, etc. Shortly after our project was born!</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>A big part of our models are done using a program built on the PICO-8 platform. Colors, textures and shape complexity are extremely limited, forcing us to think outside the box when creating our assets. It&rsquo;s challenging, but a big part of the fun. We also work with the Adobe Creative Suite to bring an extra layer of personality to our assets.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>Bakerboy: Outside of NFTs, my favourite artist is Simon Stalenhag. I love the eerie scenes he creates.</p>
        <p>WiLOUCHE: I would say Ralph Steadman because of his splatters of inks and ways of expressing through his illustrations. Really expressive, provocative and grotesk cartoonist with an original art style.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>We both followed and invested in various cryptocurrencies before exploring NFTs. Being gamers, the WAX blockchain got us interested very quickly as it seemed to be the place for blockchain games. We started (big surprise) with Alien Worlds like a lot of people, and went on from there to various projects on WAX. We are now collecting for fun and investing in projects that we personally find interesting!</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>Discord is the best place to follow our project, get updates, access drops, various giveaways and interact with our community! We also welcome everyone to try our Virus Busters: Virtual Desktop&trade;Ô∏è on our website!</p>

        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>Sure! Why not finish on a small introduction to Virus Busters lore:</p>
        <p>&ldquo;So, you might have heard that Virus Busters is looking for new employees? No? Oh well, you&rsquo;ll do just fine anyway. Let me start from the beginning. Virus Busters is a cybersecurity agency helping people with computer issues on a daily basis. Our Boss, Buster, is totally useless when it comes to computers. We don&rsquo;t complain too much, because most of the time he pays us to fix his own computer from multiple viruses he caught god knows where. Well, this time, it&rsquo;s bad. Whatever he downloaded, it managed to infect our whole system. No device has been spared. Wanna help us recover our devices and destroy those pesky viruses? &ldquo;</p>
        <p>Thank you to everyone reading this. We sure hope you will come check out our project and join our community! And a special thank you @cryptoswatch for the collaboration between his nice project and ours!</p>
