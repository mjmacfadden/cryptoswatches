        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hi my name is Timothy also known as MunK. Born on a cold Friday the 13th in January. Also as a Mental Health Worker, I&rsquo;ve seen nightmares and good times. I hail from Endicott, New York. Im really into tattoos and I have my ears gauged to 1&rdquo;. Music is something that takes me away from classic rock, punk, rap, lets just say I like it all. I&rsquo;m a big horror movie fan with comedy movies mixed in.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>The inspiration to my piece here. Is the dead feeling I have felt inside for away. Each and everyday decay can become a heartache or even things that happen in real life.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been creating art my whole life mostly. But with NFTs, I started in February of 2022. One that got me somewhat into in was Mobius Strip! For my artwork to happen &ndash; I use a iPad with a pencil. For programs it depends I usually use Sketchbook for my PFP projects. With the gif side I use motion leap and filto. When I work on a collage its either Live collage or building something in sketchbook.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>My artist influences would be some old school like Pink Floyd art or even the horror classics. Music helps like metal and rap.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>You can find me on Neftyblocks.com, Atomichub.io, Twitter. I do have stuff on opensea but rarely touch it. I love WaXp. Wax has a great community.</p>
