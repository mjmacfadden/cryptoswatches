        <h1>BunnyonWorld</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">Hello! I am Albert, the creator of Bunnyon World! Right now I live in Spain dedicating all the time I can to my collection of NFTs, from its creation to advertising on social networks.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">Since I have been experimenting with a new color palette for my Bunnyons and the collaboration is a kind of experiment, I have been inspired by doing something similar to a laboratory</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">In April 2021 I made my first Bunnyon, at that time I was working in a book warehouse and could not dedicate time to the NFTs, but I got tired of that work and since September / October I have been selling my collection. But I have been drawing for myself since I was little</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">I like the simple and I prefer to draw with the phone so I looked for a simple application and I found the Dotpict app, focused on pixel art, and nothing else, drawing pixel by pixel and frame by frame.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">Pixel art in general, but especially retro games from the 80s and 90s, I really don&rsquo;t have any specific artist as a reference.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <div dir="auto">
        <p dir="ltr">The possibility of creating and selling art in a totally independent way as well as being able to make crypto games to use the NFTs.</p>
        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <ul>

        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p dir="ltr">I am working to create my own Cryptogame with its own Cryptocurrency, the existing Bunnyon will have passive rewards in the future. I hope to have it prepared in the not too distant future</p>
