        <h1>Cyber Ducks</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><em>The following is an artist profile featuring our first partner in collaboration&mdash;the partners behind Cyber Ducks.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Luca from Italy. Actually, we are two working on this project: my girlfriend and I. I have been passionate about everything related to computers ever since I was at school. She is a creative person who worked as a graphic designer after a degree in interior design. We have combined our passions in this project.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for CyberDucks?</strong></p>
        <p>The idea came from &ldquo;PK&rdquo;, an italian comic that tells the adventures of the superhero Paperinik, a space version of Donald Duck who fights against aliens to defend the Earth. I have the complete collection, which I have kept since I was young. I am also passionate about old video games and pixel art. I collect old consoles like Nintendo and Sega. That gave me the idea to draw a pixel art project.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been working on the project?</strong></p>
        <p>Not for very long to be honest. When we saw the opportunity to show what we had in mind, we immediately put it into practice. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;work in progress!&rdquo;</p>
        <p><strong>Where do you see this project going in the future?</strong></p>
        <p>We are living the project day by day. We have a lot of creative ideas and inspirations. We look for the best way to put them into practice. We try to seize all of the opportunities that we can to make us improve.</p>
        <p>We have received positive feedback from the community, so we hope that this is just the beginning. We are very excited.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I am passionate about everything related to the latest IT news and Cryptocurrencies. It is a vast world yet to be explored, offering endless possibilities. I love NFTs and the idea behind them.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
