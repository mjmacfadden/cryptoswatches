        <h1>FeltnerIII</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>My name is David Feltner III, professionally I have been in the finance field for the past 20 years. While not working I have been creating art over the same period of time. I have kept all of my art to myself until recently. NFTs gave me the media and inspiration to get into NFTs.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>I was inspired to create this piece because I love skulls and wanted to make something different from my normal project, which is more cartoonish and fun.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>Digitally I have been creating for about 2 months.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>My typical workflow consists of small amounts of brainstorming prior to putting my focus on to paper, canvas or digitally. Depending on my mood I will mix medias and combine them to create a truly unique digital piece. When I digitally edit my works I use Adobe, 3D Paint, Pixma &amp; Open Shot amongst others. I am always trying new programs and experimenting with the limits of each.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t have much of an art background to be honest. I am familiar with major works of art from Leonardo and other old world Greek and Roman artists. I draw from those styles, as they have fantasy type feel. I really love the imagery in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I first got introduced to crypto about 6 months ago. I started watching BTC and ETH. I jumped on some Doge and Stellar Lumens, which I still Hodl. I saw that NFTs were expanding and I thought it would be a great way to express myself and my art. I love the collectibles that are out, so I am working on a series of 100 1/1 characters. The series is called the 100 Goobers. I will be dropping my 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Goober 07/31/2021 and I am very proud of that.</p>
