        <h1>WTMACFADDEN</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>A Note From Mike Macfadden (the founder of Crypto Swatch)</strong></p>
        <p>Since its conception, the crypto swatch project has evolved from a silly experimental giveaway on the WAX Blockchain, to a pretty serious (albeit still small) platform for artists and indie NFT projects. Our mission has been two sided. On the one hand, we are seeking to make collecting art as common as collecting baseball, basketball, Pok&eacute;mon, or any other trading card. On the other hand, we are seeking to raise the profile of the many talented creatives out there by featuring their work on our swatches, implementing fun blend mechanics, and sharing in the proceeds.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple, we believe that more art is better.</p>
        <p>My older brother Bill has been&nbsp;along the ride since the beginning. He holds one of the original 100 genesis pieces, and he is the second biggest collector of our collection. Additionally, he discovered a passion for painting abstract art using acrylic on canvas.</p>
        <p>Until today, his work has remained in the analog realm, but with this collaboration, his genesis NFT will forever live on a cryptoswatch backed by the power of the carbon free WAX Blockchain.</p>
        <p>While art is sometimes a speculative alternative investment vehicle, its real purpose is to evoke an emotional response from the creator and viewer. To that end, this piece certainly achieves that goal.</p>
