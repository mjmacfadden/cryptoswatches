        <h1>Cryptopups</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>I go by the name Lucifer mostly in NFT space as of now! I&rsquo;m from India, currently doing my college. I&rsquo;m not working or anything as of now. Just learning about cryptocurrency, blockchain and NFTs.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>To be frank, the inspiration is the cute doggy that you sent me and the Australian Labradoodle always gets me going they are so cute.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I have been a 2D illustrator and a 3D sculptor for over 5 years now. But why pixel art? Because I never have tried it before and I really wanna make a game like Legend of Zelda and Pokemon Fire red kinda RPG game for My pups so yeah that&rsquo;s how I started designing these and stuff</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>Workflow is pretty simple, I&rsquo;m all about pups and there&rsquo;s plenty of breeds, crossbreeds out there waiting for us to pick them up and cuddle lol. But the variants are a big deal! TBH I have to figure out an idea on how to make them useful in the game later on! I believe NFTs should have utility in the future so I&rsquo;m striving for that. I closely make variants like gentle pups could be mayor of a town in the game and there&rsquo;s this pup with halo which will help you when you die for the first time in the game kinda stuff. I use Asprite as of now for creating these.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t have any influences but if you want an influence that had be going my throat name of CryptoPups that should be CryptoPunks!</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>The idea of owning an artpiece is mind blowing in this digital age where the replication is so simple and abundant. I wanted to make something that will bring smile when people see or feel that they got my art or their own puppy. Immortal pups these are! They never die. As of now they don&rsquo;t live too but soon they will in Virtual Reality. You guys will be able to pet my Cryptopups soon before 2022 or 2023.</p>
