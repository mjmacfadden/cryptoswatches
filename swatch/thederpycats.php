        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m the creator of The Derpy Cats collection. People usually call me Derpy, Derps, or something like that. I&rsquo;m a student of informatics currently living in central Europe.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t have too much experience with digital art, only in the last six months, I&rsquo;ve been creating digitally. The Derpy Cats collection is based on a traditional piece I&rsquo;ve done a couple of years ago. I&rsquo;m not a formally trained artist and I&rsquo;m still exploring digital art. That&rsquo;s why I refer to my art as being derpy.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>I usually come up with new ideas for the collection right before I go to sleep and then I try and remember them in the morning. I have a long list of different series ideas for the collection waiting to be made. My workflow depends on a specific piece I&rsquo;m working on. For my new series of Fruits backgrounds, I start with drawings on paper which I further edit digitally.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint a specific person or a style but I love the combination of traditional and digital art a lot. Luckily, today it&rsquo;s easy to get a lot of exposure to different art styles and techniques through social media, and I get inspired by all the creative individuals out there. I get a lot of inspiration from other NFT artists and I love collaborating with them and letting them be a creative part of my collection.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I started to familiarize myself with blockchain technology about two years ago when I dabbled into some cryptocurrency investing. Since then I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the space and slowly got introduced to NFTs. I love the idea of digital collectibles and that&rsquo;s why I decided to start my own collection. As my educational background is in technology rather than art I love exploring that side of the NFT community as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share</strong></p>
        <p>I hope that the collectors will enjoy the new swatches!</p>
