        <h1>SNKRSWAX</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hi everyone, the name is Benny and I am the creator of WaxSnkrs. A sneaker collection on the wax Blockchain. IRL I am a team manager for a digital agency and I am from Ghana in Africa.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>I always try to understand the project I am collaborating with but this is cryptoswatches. I love to play with alot of colors so I really wanted to go crazy with this but I had to switch it up and do things different. Introduce an art form that was revolutionary in an era and which I have a strong attachment to. This was it, the &ldquo;childlike&rdquo; artistry of Keith Haring.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>Well, been creating for over 6 years now. Working on brands digital assets with my IRL agency.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>So basically I am an Adobe person, using a number of their softwares but Photoshop, illustrator and premier Pro are what I use mostly.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>I have a number of them but in recent times I am heavily influenced by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>Basically I am a futuristic person, so got to know about Bitcoin first, and recently I had an AHA moment that got me asking how can art be used in with Blockchain. That led me to NFT.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
