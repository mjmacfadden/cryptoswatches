        <h1>ARTS OF CLARKE</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p>Hola! I&rsquo;m Eneida Clark &ndash; New York City native now residing in the New England portion of the US. I&rsquo;m the artist behind &ldquo;Pets of&rdquo; and Art of Clark.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a big geek. Comics, movies, video games &ndash; love it. When I was younger I would recreate X-Men comics featuring my dolls as superheroes. &ldquo;Pets of&rdquo; is similar to my comics of old &ndash; to take different genres/pop culture and associate them to my passion of pets. All pets featured on the &ldquo;Pets of&rdquo; series are either mine, or pets of family/friends which gives it a neat personal touch. Art of Clark is the spookier side of things &ndash; weird dolls and all things eccentric.</p>
        <p>This particular piece features the main star of &ldquo;Pets of&rdquo;, my papillon River Song. Since it&rsquo;s my favorite time of year (Halloween woo!) I decided to depict her in a haunted forest just being her fabulous self.</p>
        <p>I use Procreate for the majority of my work and Photoshop for my animated pieces.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;d say my artistic influences are from the late 90&rsquo;s to early 2000&rsquo;s Cartoon Network shows like Powerpuff Girls and Dexter&rsquo;s Laboratory. Bright colors and an odd cast of characters. I started creating around 2019. My husband is a collector so he was a huge help in guiding me and getting me involved with the space.</p>
        <p>I can be reached via twitter&nbsp;<a title="https://twitter.com/ArtsOfClarkE" href="https://twitter.com/ArtsOfClarkE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/ArtsOfClarkE&nbsp;</a>or on discord at The House of the Horde <a title="https://discord.gg/7uU7nJ5fTn" href="https://discord.gg/7uU7nJ5fTn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.gg/7uU7nJ5fTn&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664984974094000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hm50A1Nu_qBNldTzABqST">https://discord.gg/7uU7nJ5fTn</a>. My website&nbsp;<a title="https://artofclark.io" href="https://artofclark.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://artofclark.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664984974094000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1gvFMoV3bm8Xsm8WIH33pL">https://artofclark.io</a>&nbsp;is under construction but should be finished soon.</p>
        <p>I just want to thank you for this opportunity and I hope everyone enjoys &ldquo;Pets of&rdquo; and Art of Clark. The blockchain has provided an opportunity to distribute my work to an audience that I would not have reached otherwise. It&rsquo;s an amazing opportunity to reach other artists/collectors worldwide. The community has been so awesome and supportive and I&rsquo;m just honored to be a part of it!</p>
