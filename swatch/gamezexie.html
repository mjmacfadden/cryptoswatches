        <h1>Gamezexie</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hey, This is Tex &amp; Dixieman owners of Zexie Studios, developers of Battleblockz. We&rsquo;re two hard headed fathers whom have 10+ years experience in competitive gaming and web/game development. Our goal is to bring a fresh look at NFTs and gaming and get rid of the current stigma built around this niche. After years of playing at LANs for competitive games such as COD, Halo, GoW, and many others in the United States we feel there is a huge gap in the crypto world for competitive gaming. Although we are a small team of developers, our passion and our expertise fuels the drive to bring a whole new world to the WAX Blockchain. Currently we are working full time as stack developers. We have worked with companies such as Lionsgate, Sony, and http://Theta.TV.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>Battleblockz started as a an idea built around the current state of competitive gaming. We wanted to create something that gave on edge gameplay with simplicity where anyone can pick it up. As fathers we knew the best place for inspiration would be from the next generation of gamers. Our kids wanted something simple to play as a game together and the idea evolved from there with our love for competition and NFTs.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>We both have been creating digital content for over 10 years. Starting from creating youtube tutorials on building tools using flash to achieving partner status on Twitch. Through Zexie Studios we have been able to reach people from all over the world with Podcasts, Live tournaments, and streams through the ambassador program on http://Theta.tv. When it comes to digital content there really isn&rsquo;t a platform that we have not dabbled in!</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>The use of blender, unity, illustrator, and a whole lot of debugging is what plays deeply in the creation of Battleblockz.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>The world is full of good and evil everywhere we go. We&rsquo;d like to think that Battleblockz took influence from the world around us. There is always a fight for what is right and it shows in the lore behind the game. You choose whether you are good or evil and whether or not you want to save the blockchain. We also heavily refer to the artistic nature of living inside a computer or network which is why a lot of the art is based off a block kind of look (no, this isn&rsquo;t minecraft).</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>The idea of NFTs is next level. When we first started hearing about NFT creation on Openseas we knew that whether it be a year or 10 years down the road there was a lot that could be done to change the world using NFTs.</p>
        <p>Where can we find you online?</p>
        <p>Our first drop for BattleBlockz is currently live on Nefty. Staking, crafting, and first look at gameplay is coming mid-late Feb! Be sure to stop by the discord and say hi. We&rsquo;re always in contact with our community and trying grow together in this crazy space of NFTs.</p>
