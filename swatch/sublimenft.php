            <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers :</strong></p>
            <p>My name is Simon Hyde, originally from London, but have lived in the Canary Islands for the last 14 years, on the island of Tenerife. I am the creator of Sublime Sounds, a NFT Record Label and Music NFT platform. People buy and hold our releases and gain a weekly drop of our $SSN token based on their holdings. You can also collect Artist releases to gain rarer Music Artist NFT cards.</p>
            <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
            <p>I&rsquo;ve been into Music and been a DJ for many years, hence my keen interest in a Music related project on the WAX Blockchain. I was really keen to give a platform for new age artists to present themselves, and hopefully give people opportunities that I didn&rsquo;t have earlier on, but also wanted everyone to benefit from the platform, fan, artist, collector etc etc.</p>
            <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
            <p>We started our project about 1.5 years ago and went though nearly a year of promotional activities and introducing artists and building our community. We have been creating Music NFT&rsquo;s all of that time, and have also been collaborating with other collections and artists too. Personally I have been doing Graphics Design and Website Design for many years so not totally new to the space.</p>
            <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
            <p>We use a mixture of PC and MAC for creation, we have 2 sides to ur project and 2 forms of art to consider, the ART and the Music, we use standard Adobe tools mostly for graphics including Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects for animations. For the Music production side we use varied tools but including Cubase, Fruityloops and also we have quite a bit of hardware located in the Sublime Sounds Studio, including keyboards, drums etc etc!</p>
            <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
            <p>I grew up in London in the late 1980&rsquo;s so that Music Dance scene is where I am from and where my inspiration for Music comes from, Electronic Music Genres, House, Drum n Bass, Dub, Electro. So ainly early infuencers in these scenes are what are my constant inspiration!</p>
            <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
            <p>My first discovery was WAX, and then the first NFT I got involved with was Gnomeseries ðŸ˜‰ . I spent ages waiting for someone to do something with Music on NFT&rsquo;s, as I really thought that it would be the next evolution of the Music Industry, and being a Producer and DJ myself it was something I was really passionate about. But I wanted not to create something to make me money, I wanted to create a community driven Music NFT project, that was organically grown, by it&rsquo;s artists and their fan bases, so that everyone gets the chance to earn the SSN token and basically own a piece of the project .</p>
