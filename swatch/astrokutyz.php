        <h1>Astrokutyz</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hello everyone! I am Astro Kutyz, a French 3D artist, 34 years old. I am currently a freelance web developer, based in Brittany, France! I live near the ocean. This is a wonderful source of inspiration and a great environnement to relax the mind and nourish the spirit.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>My inspiration for this piece was simple! As the name Astro Kutyz suggests, I love space a lot&nbsp;! To me this immense and eternal night filled with surprise ( whether it be good or bad) has always been fascinating.</p>
        <p>Space is also a big part of my culture. As a kid, I loved Startrek, Stargate, Alien and all those big classics. More recently I have binged &laquo;&nbsp;Lost in Space&nbsp;&raquo; on netflix and found it quite cool.</p>
        <p>As far as videogames are concerned, i m of course a big fan of Starcraft.</p>
        <p>You now understand why Space was so an obvious topic for me to tackle. Blowing up a planet seemed like a good approach to it haha</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm</strong>?</p>
        <p>8 years ago I used to work as a technical drawer and industrial modeler. After this job I lost contact with 3D creation for some time to focus on different kinds of creations (more web based). In february of this year I stumbled upon an article about NFT. It striked me and I immediately found it appealing concidering my background. That is how I started with NFT. So as you can see I have been in the field of digital creation for quite some years now but NFT&rsquo;s are quite new&hellip;</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>For the equipment, I use a fairly basic gaming laptop:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A latop Nitro AN515-42<br />Processor:</li>
        <li>AMD Ryzen 5 2500U<br /><span lang="en-US">Graphics Card:</span></li>
        <li><span lang="en-US">Radeon RX 5660X Series</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I outsource my rendering tasks in Belgium, wich help me a lot.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>I have always been attracted to various artistic creations. Especially video games that have been a huge influence in my youth (I feel old saying that hahaha). For example a few masterpieces that have influenced me a lot: Oddworld: -The Odyssey of Abe, Another world, Starcraft and its universe&hellip; I&rsquo;m not going to quote them all, there are too many.</p>
        <p>Likewise, literature has also had a big impact on me, SF and Heroic fantasy in particular:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Waylander (David Gemmell)</li>
        <li>Magician: Apprentice (Raymond E. Feist)</li>
        <li>Deathstalker (Simon R. Green)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And once I m not gonna quote them all&nbsp;! .</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I think the most appealing part in this whole NFT space is total freedom. We are free to express ourselves, to be ourselves and to communicate around very complex topics in a really relevant way.</p>
        <p>The community in general is absolutely amazing. I have met so many great people, learned so much and realised I could even bring my experience and teach what I know. I feel like knowledge sharing is a big part of all this NFT thing.</p>
        <p>And wait the most important of all&nbsp;! Every time I start working on a new nft, I feel like a kid waking up on Christmas morning hahaha</p>
        <p>NFT crafting is definitely a passion that will not dry up anytime soon.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<strong>Where can we find you online (Twitter, website, Instagram, OpenSea, Rarible, etc?)</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;You can find me on social networks:</p>

        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>First of all, I would like to thank you for your work. And of course, I wanna thank the NFTS community for being such a space of free expression and creation&nbsp;!</p>
        <p>Have a good end-of-year celebration !!</p>
