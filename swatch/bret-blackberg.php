        <h1>Bret Blackberg</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Dan (aka Bret). I live in the US and have been creating an NFT comic since March with the first release in June. My real world job is in sales.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?<br /></strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been a fan of all forms of comics for decades, which is my inspiration for all of my work, including this one.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I originally went to school for graphic and web design, which means I&rsquo;ve been making digital art since the late 90s.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>For my comics I jot down ideas and create storyboards/thumbnails, then I apply &ldquo;pencils&rdquo;, &ldquo;inks&rdquo;, colors and finally lettering (text/bubbles). I do a good majority of this in Clip Studio Pro. I also use Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>My influences come from comics and cartoons. Most of my artwork is inspired from the old Hannah Barbara type cartoons. The stories I create are rooted in comedy, but also takes elements of superhero adventures and RPGs (both tabletop and video games).</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I got interested in NFTs in February when Dogecoin was booming (I didn&rsquo;t buy, btw). I&rsquo;d been told by friends to get into crypto since 2017, but I never took the dive until I found out about NFTs after doing my own research. I bought some Ethereum, then learned about WAX, which is where I started making NFTs.</p>
