        <h1>@KRYPTOGALAXY</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>Hi! We&rsquo;re Julie and Marco (also known as Julxie and Mako), the creators of Krypto Galaxy and Mako&rsquo;s Gallery, and we&rsquo;re from the Philippines. We&rsquo;ve met in college in 2015 and have been best friends since then. Mako is now a graduate of Mechanical Engineering and Julxie is currently a Nursing student.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>We always love to go on food trips, and we used to stay in coffee shops whenever we study. Also, smoothies and COFFEE!</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>We&rsquo;re both very young when we had interest in drawing. We both do portraits and paintings, and just recently shifted to creating a digital artwork. We started talking about NFTs one day and just by a simple conversation, we have created our unique collection &ndash; Krypto Galaxy. We continue to explore and practice until we become better in doing our craft and passion.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>We both use only our smartphones to create art. Our phones became our companion, most especially during this time of pandemic. For Mako, starting with creating a sketch and having a vision on what the artwork will look like in the end is very important. It&rsquo;s better to sketch the ideas on a paper first, and finally do the line work digitally. Sometimes it takes 2-3 hours just by coloring a single art piece.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>Having a digital artwork that is easily accessible even on a smartphone is really interesting, and through these digital collectibles, we are able to share our talents to the whole world.</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share</strong></p>
        <p>Always remember to be kind and be an inspiration to others. Nothing is impossible, and you can always turn ideas into reality. We love you, our dearest Earthlings!</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
