        <h1>Spaceman</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>A Brief History:</strong></p>
        <p>When I first launched the Crypto Swatch project, I had no idea what it would become. The first 10-20 NFTs that I launched were just solid color swatches. There was next to no roadmap, and most of them were given away for free.</p>
        <p>Over time, I realized that a cryptoswatch could be an excellent platform for showcasing the work of creative collaborators. For the better part of a year, I&rsquo;ve been doing just that&mdash;collaborating with digital artists from all over the world.</p>
        <p>Thousands of cryptoswatches now exist in the WAX ecosystem, but lately I&rsquo;ve been considering what else cryptoswatch could be.</p>
        <p><strong>What Are &ldquo;Originals?&rdquo;</strong></p>
        <p>While I generally consider myself more of a designer than an artist, I can&rsquo;t deny that I sometimes feel the urge to express myself artistically. I have innumerable projects that have never seen the light of day, but I think it&rsquo;s about time that changed.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Crypto Swatch Originals&rdquo; are my outlet for sharing my artistic creative projects. I feel somewhat self conscious about this endeavor, but growth only takes place at the edge of your comfort zone, so here we are.</p>
        <p><strong>About This Piece:</strong></p>
        <p>I wasn&rsquo;t always a space geek, but in recent years, I have become obsessed with the industry. There is nothing that is more awe inspiring than the cosmos. &ldquo;Spaceman&rdquo; pays homage to this part of me and is also a venture into a new medium.</p>
        <p>This piece started on an iPad using Procreate with an Apple Pencil 2 and was then animated in Photoshop. I really enjoyed the freedom of stylus on tablet compared to mouse and screen.</p>
        <p>I hope you love this piece as much as I enjoyed creating it. Thank you for your continued support.</p>
        <p>Onward. and upward!</p>
