        <h1>Monica Rempel</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>My name is Monica and I live in a small town in rural Manitoba Canada. I&rsquo;ve been a full time domestic engineer for the last 19 years, often working 3 double shifts around the clock and I haven&rsquo;t had a break since the day 1.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I started to create artwork again for the first time in 2021 but I don&rsquo;t create artwork in the digital form. I prefer to get messy with colourful pastels or a bit dirty with the charcoals. Sometimes I use watercolours as well. I like to create the old school way, like I did when I was younger.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>The inspiration for my Garden Pack is my love for nature and bringing more beautiful things into a world that is filled with so much darkness. When I was younger I used to create art to express that darkness, but ever since I became a mother, that desire to create dark art has faded and now I want to bring forth more beauty. I have always been fascinated by insets and flowers and I enjoy the process of watching and nurturing plants and flowers to grow, so it&rsquo;s only natural that my art reflects that.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow?</strong></p>
        <p>I use real materials like pastels and watercolour paint and start with a reference photo usually. I&rsquo;m still getting back into the artistic groove so there isn&rsquo;t as much art from my imagination yet, though every image I create is given my own artistic touch. My husband photographs and then photoshops my work to bring it into the metaverse.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>I had a lot of artistic influences when I was in high school, but these days I am influenced by nature and do my best to capture the beauty around me.* What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</p>
        <p>My husband is a very pushy person when it comes to helping people unleash their artistic side. He has been pushing me to get back into art for years and now I&rsquo;ve finally decided to give it a chance.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t actually enjoy being online yet, though my husband is pushing me to get more involved. I am still a full time mom and I take care of a busy household. Between that and creating artwork, I don&rsquo;t find the time or have the desire to spend the time online. I know that will change as my children grow and move out of the home, so for now I try to focus on them and the my own island of reality.</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>I just want to thank everyone for their kindness and amazing support they have shown me and other artists all around the world. The NFT scene is quickly becoming a place where artists can find their audience, and the audience can find and support the artists. I know my journey is just beginning and I look forward to growing as an artist as the NFT scene continues to grow and empower people across the globe.</p>
