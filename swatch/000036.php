            <p class="text-end">by Mike Macfadden</p>
            <p><em>The following is an artist profile featuring&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/maiki_NFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@maiki_NFT</a></strong>, the creator of the animation in this series.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
            <p>Hi, I am Maik. I come from a small village in Germany and currently I am living in Hamburg. I&acute;ve been working in the so-called &ldquo;creative industry&rdquo; for the last 10 years, doing mostly animations and illustrations for&nbsp;movies, documentaries and the advertising industry, but I didn&acute;t like &ldquo;the industry&rdquo; so much, so I quit a year ago and now I have a relaxed job&mdash;just three days a week in a small shop&mdash;and the rest of the time, I make my own stuff, at the moment mostly nft-related.</p>
            <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
            <p>Haha, I don&acute;t know. Don&acute;t you think you should have bought more bitcoin?</p>
            <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
            <p>In the digital realm for 10 years at least, but with NFTs i started maybe a month ago&hellip;</p>
            <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
            <p>I sketch a lot and if there is an idea worth producing, I use photoshop and illustrator mostly to create my animations.</p>
            <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
            <p>That&acute;s hard to tell because there is a lot of stuff that keeps me inspired everyday. I love to read, listen to music and watch anime. I cannot give concrete names, but what keeps me motivated doing NFTs<br />is the great community we have, especially on WAX. people like you, a lot of the nice collectors or other NFT artists like my acid ally sillypsyben&nbsp;<a title="@PsySilly" href="https://twitter.com/PsySilly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@PsySilly</a>&nbsp;(check him out!) are keeping me motivated to produce.</p>
            <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
            <p>I have been producing things my whole life and the best thing about NFTs is that i can produce them almost anonymously, so i just started.</p>
            <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
            <p>My website is down at the moment, but I think there will be a new one soon. You can find me on twitter:&nbsp;<em><strong><a title="@maiki_nft" href="https://twitter.com/maiki_NFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@maiki_NFT</a>,</strong></em>&nbsp;on<br />WAX: erfb.wam, or you can just check out the secondary market on atomichub:&nbsp;<a href="https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=maikis1anfts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name%3Dmaikis1anfts&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616783047112000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxGiBQ7jOqTc7WGTosRx4eCm7upA">https://wax.atomichub.io/<wbr />market?collection_name=<wbr />maikis1anfts</a></p>
            <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share</strong></p>
            <p>Thanks for this great collaboration! Always hit me up if there is a nice project i can participate in,&nbsp;and if there is someone very good with the techi stuff and wants to help me produce blind packages with NFTs, setting up the blenders right, hit me up.</p>
            <p>Have a blessed day and don&acute;t believe everything they tell you.</p>
