        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>Hi, im Katie the creator of My Cartoon Family. I work for the government (not very exciting), im from Dublin Ireland.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>When I was introduced to cryptoswatch I just saw my 3 charaters interacting with one of the swatchs in a fun way. What better way to interact with a colour swatch than to paint it ðŸ˜Š</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I have been active for about 2 months now but I started planning and thinking of ideas about 4 months ago.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>As my charaters are based off my family, my ideas come from when something funny happens and their individual personalities.</p>
        <p>I am always trying to learn new softwares currently giving blender ago, but at the moment I use autodesk on my tablet to draw, then I animate in after effects.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>In modern art I love Banksy and Andy Warhole, in NFT there are many artist i really like but my very first NFT was a crypomonkey and that peeked my interest.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>My boyfriend lol, he found the NFT world and started showing me the ones he collected, so naturally I started to fall in love with them.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online (Twitter, website, Instagram, OpenSea, Rarible, etc?)</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>My twitter is:&nbsp;<a title="https://twitter.com/Cartoon_Family1" href="https://twitter.com/Cartoon_Family1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://twitter.com/Cartoon_Family1</a></li>

        </ul>
