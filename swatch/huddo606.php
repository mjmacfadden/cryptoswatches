        <h1>HUDDO606</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hey im Huddo from NSW Australia. Creating art for the artbyhuddo21 range, family man with a wife and 3 kids.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>The inspiration from this piece was a really peaceful sky that later afternoon. I have been enjoying drawing cities from different perspectives</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I have been creating for about 11 months in the digital space and it&rsquo;s been 20 years since I just took the time to sit and draw.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>I use mostly pro create on my iPad (when the kids don&rsquo;t have it ðŸ˜‰ ) As far as processes I&rsquo;m still learning all of that. I&rsquo;m really new to drawing and just having fun with it and doing lots of drawing time with my kids.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>I have so many influences with art. A massive influence isn&rsquo;t even in the digital space yet, Mitch Revs here in Australia, his art is fun &amp; colourful. But I love so many wax artists and their work.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>You can find my work on nefty and atomic hub and links to both of those here:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Atomic Hub</li>
        <li>Nefty</li>
