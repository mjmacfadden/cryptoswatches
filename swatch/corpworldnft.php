        <h1>CorpWorld_NFT</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>Hello, I am Jonezy, creator of Corporate World (Hell on Earth). I am a self-taught artist. When I am not on the laptop, you would see me sketching, building LEGOs, or playing console games. I love the process of creation and building something.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>BeelzeBoss is the main character of the Corporate World collection. He came about when I did a doodle of a demon in a business suit holding a contract. Found the doodle again and poof it clicked!</p>
        <p>He&rsquo;s the CEO of the H.E.L.L. company. His unique aura leads to a literally toxic environment. It morphed the employees into their worst versions of themselves.</p>
        <p>The whole project is somewhat a satirical look at workplace life, but I have exaggerated it a tad bit.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>I have been creating in the digital realm for a long time. I do illustrations, graphic design and created websites and apps for different companies.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (what equipment and software do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>I usually start with pencil/paper and sketch out a rough of the character. Then, I scan/take a picture of it then import it to Procreate on the iPad. Once in Procreate, I clean up the sketch and make a better sketch, then move on to inking and coloring. Once done, I move it to Photoshop where I lay it out on the card/NFT.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>There are so many artists to mention. Anything weird or visually stunning appeals to me. Amongst the various influences are pop surrealism/lowbrow art, vintage comics, retro animations, Japanese manga/anime, graffiti, and more.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>I have always liked the idea of creating my own collectibles. Ever since I am a kid. I tend to come up with weird characters and create comics or collector cards made out of paper/cardboard. Now that NFTs are here, I have a digital medium to spread my ideas and characters.</p>

        <p>I will continue creating NFTs for you! There are still a lot of characters and creatures locked inside my head and want to get out.</p>
