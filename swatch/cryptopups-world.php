        <h1>Cryptopups World</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>I am Apple&nbsp;(my artist name), I&rsquo;m the creator of the Cryptopups. Professionally, I am a graphics designer from the Philippines. I do minimalist logos, posters, business cards and many more.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>So, for our collaboration piece I decided to do a mothers day special. I also named the cryptopup &ldquo;Swatchy&rdquo; to match the collab partner. Mothers day is a special day for all the mothers in the world, so I decided to dedicate an NFT for them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>As for how long I&rsquo;ve been designing in the digital space, I started around 2 years ago; making logos, cards, posters, etc. But, for NFTs, I just started a month ago and have built a wonderful community.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>My workflow is kind of a mess (but im working on it). I learned from various designers that having references is a good way to come up with a design. So, before I start designing I come up with a vague idea and I look for references. from there, I start fitting different elements till I come up with something I like.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>As far as artist influencers are concerned, I really don&rsquo;t have a specific favourite. I appreciate art, I appreciate artists, I love how every artist has a story and has a passion to create art.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>Before I started NFTs I was striving as a graphics designer / Video Editor. I didn&rsquo;t really have enough luck since graphics design is unappreciated in our country. but then, I discovered crypto and NFTs. I came across beeple, who sold his art for 69M$. Then I also decided to join in on the craze; but it was difficult at first. People were only interested in selling their own NFTs; so I decided to create a community of my own where we can trade, have fun, collect and support each other.&nbsp;</p>
