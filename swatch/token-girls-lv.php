        <h1>Token Girls LV</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?</strong></p>
        <p>Hello, everyone! We are Token Girls! Token Girls is an NFT collection featuring crypto-girls. In a nutshell, we are developing the universe with girls that image popular cryptocurrencies and do some&nbsp;activities. We are&nbsp;planning to make music and write stories that show you relations with characters, their goals, and motivations. So we make different kinds of content. As for authors, we live in Russia and Ukraine, but people who help us live in the USA.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>When we created Token Girls, we were inspired by many of the ideas that surrounded us. I was interested in cryptocurrencies, and we have a strong wish to make a well-designed universe, so that&rsquo;s why we come up with the idea to make Token Girls. The images of the characters are based on many factors: sometimes they are very obvious, such as the one that Tron is Chinese, sometimes not. In your case, we decided to make a street artist with a slightly unusual character.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been designing in the digital realm?</strong></p>
        <p>We have been drawing for a long time. I even can say that since childhood. But Token Girls is too young: it will soon be only two months old.</p>
        <p><strong>Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?</strong></p>
        <p>My partner and I discuss the ideas that came to our minds during the day, think over them and choose those the liked ones. That&rsquo;s all. We use Asesprite as an art tool. God, bless the creators of this thing. If you draw in pixel art, be sure to use this program.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>My partner&rsquo;s favorite artist is Eric Barone, the man who made Stardew Valley. In my case, that&rsquo;s a good question. Two people played a big artistic role in my life &ndash; Hideo Kojima and Shigeru Miyamoto.</p>
        <p><strong>What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?</strong></p>
        <p>The funny thing is that I answer this question differently. It depends on the time when people asked me. Initially, I learned about NFT from the news. AtomicHub was the best choice for us &ndash; it looked user-friendly. But now, I should say that NFTCommunity has given us something special. They became our family. I don&rsquo;t think that the family could be sold or minted.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
