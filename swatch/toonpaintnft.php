        <h1>TOONPAINTNFT</h1>
        <h4>by Michael Macfadden</h4>
        <p><strong>Please introduce yourself to our readers:</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a self-taught artist created in Dundas, ON Canada.</p>
        <p><strong>What was the inspiration for this piece?</strong></p>
        <p>This piece originates from my most recent b&bull;w series and is the second image in what became fifteen drawings this time around. It&rsquo;s the only one from this particular storyline that will be available on WAX and is inspired by the idea of entrapment and rescue experienced by both parties in a relationship.</p>
        <p><strong>How long have you been creating in the digital realm and what is your workflow like?</strong></p>
        <p>My creations joined the digital realm in 2009 when I started a webcomic. I was going to buy a wacom tablet around that same time but never got around to it. I still draw everything by hand and then edit and colour using a scanner, laptop (photoshop elements) and mouse. Considering I also paint and draw in a variety of styles, the combination of classic and modern techniques has a relentless appeal to me.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are your artistic influences?</strong></p>
        <p>My influences are cartoonists, writers, musicians, filmmakers and painters (probably in that order). It began with comic strips and Mad Magazine, particularly cartoonists Jim Davis, Don Martin, Sergio Aragones, Shel Silverstein, Quentin Blake, Charles Schulz, Bill Watterson and perhaps everything animated on television from 1950-1990. I started reading Stephen King around the fifth grade and also fell in love with Freddy Krueger and horror movies. Eventually Ralph Steadman, Harvey Kurtzman, R. Crumb, Walt Kelly, Will Eisner, George Herriman plus a slew of painters came into my early adulthood. I&rsquo;m constantly collecting the best biographies and documentaries I can find &ndash; including all things punk, jazz and original hip hop as well. If I ever have my own art studio, library, study and work space, I will never leave it.</p>
        <p><strong>Where can we find you online?</strong></p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<a title="@toonpaintNFT" href="https://twitter.com/toonpaintNFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@toonpaintNFT</a>&nbsp;on Twitter and my Symphony Syds collection (1/1, sourced from original art using the concept of hundreds of unique characters tightly and quickly hand inked as a classic composer would write out sheet music) is on&nbsp;<a title="OpenSea" href="https://opensea.io/collection/symphony-syds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSea</a>, gradually gearing up for its second drop. I will also finally be releasing my collection of 1/1 artwork this year, most featuring my main character who appears here now.</p>
        <p><strong>Anything else you&rsquo;d like to share?</strong></p>
        <p>That&rsquo;s it, thank you, Crypto Swatch, I love and appreciate your concept, design and support.</p>
